# TFT Game Tracker App

## The Project:

- ***What will the application do?***
    - The application will track TFT games, allowing the user to input their time, date, placement and team comp played for each game. Returning total statistics for all games saved: totals for each placement (1th - 8th), average winrate where all placements above 4th count as a win, and number of times each comp has been played 
    - The application can save and restore the entire state of the application
  
  
- ***Who will use it?***
  - Users who play TFT and who wish to track the progress of their TFT games will use this application. TFT (aka Teamfight Tactics) is an auto battler game that can be played on desktop among other platforms 
  

- ***Why is this project of interest to you?***
  - This project is of interest to me because I enjoy playing TFT in my free time and it would be helpful to have something to keep track of as many games as I want. I could use this project to keep track of games played during a single session or even track my long term progress.
